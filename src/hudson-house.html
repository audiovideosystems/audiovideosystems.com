        <p class="body">We worked closely with the developers to ensure that our design and integration was top-of-the-line. This included 2 pools, multiple lifts and standard audio/video control systems. A Crestron system was designed to control the indoor and outdoor pools. The Lutron lighting system was programmed for indoor and outdoor lighting scenes. The home also included full integration of audio and video, HVAC, security and gate control.</p>
