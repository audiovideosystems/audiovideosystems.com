description: Our work on this project began at the homeâ€™s inception when the builder and architect brought us in. Our team meticulously planned out every detail, including controls for audio/video, lighting, a pool and hot tub, and the eventual addition of a barn and riding arena. This secondary phase of work was completed in 2015, and gave the main house control over the lighting, HVAC and A/V via fiber optic connection.
